## Intro

Hello, I began this project with the starter code provided by Udacity. The goal was to make the game function and interactive. Please enjoy.

## Dependencies

- Visual Studio Code text editor
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Font Awesome via BootstrapCDN
- Font Family Coda via Google API
- Udacity starter code
- Google Chrome browser and dev tools

## Contributing

Starter code provided by Udacity. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details

## Known Bugs

I was able to figure out how to remove the bullet points for the star stats on modal bux, but couldn't figure out how to format the stars to be displayed horizonally

#Notes to Reviewer:
- I updated resetGame() function to clear open cards from previous game
- I updated event listener for card clicks w/ conditional to prevent move counter from incrementing when an open card is clicked multiple times
- I updated READme to include dependencies

## Potential

- Add animations
- Add a progress bar
- Use cute animal gifs for card images instead of icons
- Add background music
