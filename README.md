## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Known Bugs

- I was able to figure out how to remove the bullet points for the star stats on modal bux, but couldn't figure out how to format the stars to be displayed horizonally

## Potential

- Add more animations
- Add a progress bar
