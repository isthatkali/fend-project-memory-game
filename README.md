## Intro

Hello, I began this project with the starter code provided by Udacity. The goal was to make the game function and interactive. Please enjoy.

## Contributing

Starter code was pulled from Udacity. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details

## Known Bugs

I was able to figure out how to remove the bullet points for the star stats on modal bux, but couldn't figure out how to format the stars to be displayed horizonally

## Potential

- Add animations
- Add a progress bar
- Use cute animal gifs for card images instead of icons
- Add background music
